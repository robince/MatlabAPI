!  This function takes not inputs and generates one output. What it does is go through
!  a series of MATLAB API function calls to demonstrate the use of the module functions
!  for real matrices in the following files:
!
!  MatlabAPImx.f   - Interface definitions for the MATLAB API mx___ functions
!  MatlabAPImex.f  - Interface definitions for the MATLAB API mex___ functions
!
!  Both files have extra routines that are not part of the original MATLAB API
!  function list. Some of the extra routines are drop-in replacements for original
!  MATLAB API functions that were not part of the Fortran API. Other routines are
!  brand new ... e.g. all of the Fortran pointer routines. See comments in these
!  files for details on the interface for these functions.
!
!  The output from this routine is simply text output that demonstrates the progress
!  of the routine as it is running.

! Generate a 2D double matrix for testing. Get a Fortran pointer to
! the real data and fill it with random numbers. Note that we are
! getting direct access to the data area of the mxArray variable mx
! through the use of the fpGetPr function. No data copying is involved.
! Also, the Fortran pointers can be used as regular Fortran arrays
! for all calculations in this routine. No need to use the messy %VAL()
! construct (that's buried behind the fpGetPr function). In this example,
! Afp2D and Zfp1D actually point to exactly the same memory, namely the
! real data area of the mxArray variable mx. The difference is that
! Afp2D treats the memory as a 2D matrix whereas Zfp1D treats the memory
! as a 1D matrix. The shape of the data area is automatically calculated
! inside the fpGetPr and gpGetPr1 functions and is a part of the Fortran
! pointer that is returned. Neat! For C programmers, note the difference
! here between Fortran pointers and C pointers. C pointers contain *only*
! a raw address and the type of object being pointed to (typically).
! Fortran pointers, however, always carry along with them not only the
! type being pointed to, but the shape and stride of the target. If you
! call a routine that expects a matrix as input, like the subroutines
! DisplayMatrixExplicit2 and DisplayMatrixImplicit2, then the address
! of the target will automatically be passed. I.e., it is like the
! pointer gets automatically dereferenced everywhere it is used as an
! array instead of a pointer. Nice!

! Access the input matrix by copying into an allocatable variable. Here you

! However, it requires a wasteful data copy. Also, the allocation uses the
! Fortran memory manager, not the MATLAB memory manager, so the MATLAB
! memory manager will know nothing about this memory and cannot garbage
! collect it. Again, this works but it is not the best way. This is kind
! of a mix of F95 features (use of an allocatable variable) and F77 features
! (the call to mxCopyPtrToReal8). The better way is to use the Fortran
! pointer routines demonstrated two sections up (fpGetPr function).

! Now lets allocate a Fortran pointer using the MATLAB API mxMalloc function

! We don't have to use the clumsy mxCopyPtrToReal8 routine. Remember to
! deallocate the memory after we are done with it (the target data behind the
! Bfp2D pointer is dynamically allocated). Note that since this method uses the
! mxMalloc function in the background, the MATLAB memory manager knows about
! this dynamically allocated memory and can garbage collect it. Since the
! fpAllocate function returns a pointer, we need to use the => pointer
! assignment operator instead of the usual = assignment operator.

! Now do the same thing we just did, but using the all-in-one fpGetCopy function.
! Note the use of the => pointer assignment operator here, since the fpGetCopy
! function returns a pointer. Don't forget to deallocate the memory when done
! with it. If you forget to use the => pointer assignment operator and instead
! use the regular = assignment operator, your program will bomb. That is
! because the statement Bfp2D = fpGetPrCopy(mx) means "Copy the data area of
! mx into the target that Bfp2D is currently pointing to". But since Bfp2D
! is null and does not have a valid target yet, this will attempt to copy into
! invalid memory and hence bomb your program. Bottom line: Always remember to
! use the => pointer assignment operator with the fpGet___ functions unless
! you really do want to do a data copy.
