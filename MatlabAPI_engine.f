!  This program goes through a series of MATLAB API function calls to demonstrate
!  the use of the module functions in the following files:
!
!  MatlabAPImx.f   - Interface definitions for the MATLAB API mx___ functions
!  MatlabAPIeng.f  - Interface definitions for the MATLAB API eng___ functions
!
!  Both files have extra routines that are not part of the original MATLAB API
!  function list. Some of the extra routines are drop-in replacements for original
!  MATLAB API functions that were not part of the Fortran API. Other routines are
!  brand new ... e.g. all of the Fortran pointer routines. See comments in these
!  files for details on the interface for these functions.
!
!  This routine generates a plot of a spiral. On repeated calls, the background
!  color of the axis will change to random colors. Enter any non-blank input to
!  quit.
