!  This function takes not inputs and generates no outputs. What it does is go through
!  a series of MATLAB API function calls to demonstrate the use of the module functions
!  in the following files:
!
!  MatlabAPImx.f   - Interface definitions for the MATLAB API mx___ functions
!  MatlabAPImex.f  - Interface definitions for the MATLAB API mex___ functions
!
!  Both files have extra routines that are not part of the original MATLAB API
!  function list. Some of the extra routines are drop-in replacements for original
!  MATLAB API functions that were not part of the Fortran API. Other routines are
!  brand new ... e.g. all of the Fortran pointer routines. See comments in these
!  files for details on the interface for these functions.
!
!  This routine generates a plot of a spiral. On repeated calls, the background
!  color of the axis will change to random colors. e.g., at the MATLAB command
!  line do this:
!
!  >> MatlabAPI_getset
!  >> MatlabAPI_getset
!  >> MatlabAPI_getset
!  >> MatlabAPI_getset
!           :
!          etc.
